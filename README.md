## ✅ About

The **Smart Adaptive Traffic Signal System** is designed to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas by dynamically optimizing signal phases using real-time traffic data.  
It uses:
- **Computer Vision** to detect vehicle count & density.
- **Machine Learning** algorithms to predict optimal signal timings.
- **Web interface** to monitor and control the system.
- **DevOps pipeline** to deploy it on the cloud.
